# `match`, later

`match` is implemented: the rules are in CLAUDE.md's *Match* section and the
specification's *The match statement*. What is left is the longer road.

## Generated code a person would write

The checker turns a match into an if/else-if chain or nested ternaries, which
every target emits unchanged, so the first implementation needed no backend
work. The cost is the shape of the output: Go gets `if … else { if … }`,
Kotlin nested `if` expressions, JavaScript chained `?:`, where each has a
construct that says it -- Go's `switch`, Kotlin's `when`, JavaScript's
`switch` -- and an exhaustive match over an enum is exactly what a compiler
checks a `when` for.

1. Keep the match in the IR: an `ir.Match` statement and expression the
   checker produces instead of the chain, with the subject, the arms'
   patterns and whether the last arm is taken unasked.
2. Lower it to the chain in a pass every target gets unless its language
   declares `#[gen.can(match)]` -- the capability polarity `sngl:x/gen`
   already uses, so a target that has not heard of it keeps working.
3. Teach the walks that ask an `if` what it holds to ask a match the same:
   `ir.TransparentBlocks`, the family, slot, element-ref and `.empty` rules,
   the interpreter, the optimizer's folds, the reactivity pass's render slots.
   Each is a case beside the `if` it already has, and the reason the first
   implementation did not keep one.
4. Emit it natively in Go, Kotlin and JavaScript, view bodies included where
   the platform renders statements (Compose's `when` in a composable).

## Language

- A binding pattern (`var name`), once there is a use beyond unwrapping an
  option: payload enums, or guards (`var n if n > 10`).
- Option-unwrapping syntax of its own.
